What do you mean by 'Ultrasimplified'?

1. Real World Demos üöÄ
You won't find basic hello world demos here. The demos have been intentionally designed to be actually helpful and relatable.

2. Mimics your day-to-day job as a developer üñ•
Each pattern is implemented and discussed via a pull request. View the PRs. Read the descriptions. Read the comments. Like you do at work!

Coming from my Udemy Course?
The branch we start off from is branch clean-slate. See branch
Every lesson starts off in a new "clean-slate" branch e.g. "clean-slate-01", "clean-slate-02", "clean-slate-03" etc.
The development DEMO site lives here: <https://dev-advanced-react-patterns-ultrasimplified.netlify.com/>
But I'm just a beginner. Isn't this too advanced?
Ideally, you're not new to React. This is targetted more towards intermediate React engineers, but I'm sure a diligent beginner may work through these PRs as well.

Some comforting words: working through these patterns in a set of PRs allows you to focus on a bit at a time, with only new changes considered. Give it a try. It might turn out easier than you think.
